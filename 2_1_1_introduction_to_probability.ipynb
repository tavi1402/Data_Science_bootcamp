        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a summary of the concepts and results we've covered in this tutorial:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Probability**: The probability of a condition/event is a number between 0 and 1. It indicates how likely the event is to occur or how likely it is that a condition holds true.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Equally likely outcomes**: When we have several equally likely outcomes, the probability of a condition is defined as\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(\\textrm{condition}) = \\frac{\\textrm{ No. of outcomes satisfying the condition }} {\\textrm{Number of equally likely outcomes}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Estimating probability**: We can estimate the probability of a condition by repeating an experiment several times\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(\\textrm{condition}) \\approx \\frac{\\textrm{ No. of experiments satisfying the condition }} {\\textrm{No. of experiments conducted}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Addition rule**: Given two conditions/events $A$ and $B$, we can compute the probability of either of A or B occurring as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A \\textrm{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\textrm { and } B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Mutually exclusive events**: Two conditions/events $A$ and $B$ are said to be mutually exclusive if they cannot occur together i.e. $P(A \\textrm{ and } B) = 0$. E.g. Getting a 6 and getting a 4 on a die roll are mutually exclusive events. In such a case:\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Complement of an event** Given an event $A$, the condition $A^C$ represents the condition that $A$ does not occur. It is called the complement of $A$, and its probability is given by the relation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(\\textrm { not } A) = 1 - P(A)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A^C) = 1 - P(A)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Sum of Probabilities**: The sum of probabilities of all the possible mutually exclusive outcomes is 1. The set of all possible outcomes is called the *sample space* and is denoted by $S$.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(S) = 1$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Independent Events**: Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be independent if outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other. For independent events,\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Multiplication Rule**: Given two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of both $A$ and $B$ occurring can be computed as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B | A)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A \\cap B) = P(B)P(A | B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Probability of dependent events**: Given two events $A$ and $B$, if the outcome of $B$ is dependent on the outcome of $A$, $P(B)$ can be computed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(B) = P(A \\cap B) + P(A^C \\cap B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(B) = P(A)P(B|A) + P(A^C)P(B|A^C)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Bayes Theorem**: Given two events $A$ and $B$, we can compute $P(A|B)$ using $P(B|A)$ as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
